# ML-student-performance-predictor
A machine learning project that predicts student pass/fail outcomes based on attendance, midterm exam scores, and assignment performance using logistic regression.

# Student Performance Predictor (ML Project)

This project predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail based on their academic metrics using Machine Learning classification.

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

## 📁 Dataset:
Includes columns:
- attendance (%)
- midterm_score (out of 50)
- assignment_score (out of 50)
- final_result (Pass/Fail)

## 📈 Model:
Uses logistic regression classifier to train and predict final results.

## 🏁 Run Instructions:
1. Install libraries in `requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook `StudentPerformance_Predictor.ipynb`
3. Modify the prediction cell to try different inputs!
